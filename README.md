# Glow-Tic-Tac-Toe
A 2-Player Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application 

A 3-hr project that I leisurely took to evaluate my HTML, CSS, Javascript skills.
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe supporting Dark/Light Modes with Responsive Design and Well Defined Transitions built using HTML and CSS.
Working of game coded entirely with Vanilla Javascript with a Logic of my own.
